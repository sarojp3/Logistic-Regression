## Improving Neural Networks 

<p>There are many ways to improve the working of neural network and make it more efficient by reducing problems like overfitting and underfitting.</p>

<p>Some of the common techniques used are:</p>

  * Hyperparameter Tuning
        <p>This includes tuning the values of parameters like learning rate, number of iterations, number of hidden layers and hidden units, choice of activation function and so on.Small changes in these paramters can have great effect on a neural network.</p>
  * Regularization 
        <p>Regularization is mainly used to reduce overfitting(high variance) of the data. It is used so that the neural network will compute/produce simpler linear functions rather than very complex non-linear functions.L2 Regularization and Dropout Regularization is the most common techniques which is used most often.</p>
  * Optimization
         <p>Optimization allows the neural network to learn faster and achieve better performance. To optimize, we can normalize the inputs that makes the cost function look more symmetric.By initializing weights appropriately and checking gradients can help in optimization as well.</p>
